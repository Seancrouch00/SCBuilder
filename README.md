# SCBuilder
**Title**: GitHub Repository Build and Installation Script

**Description**: This script automates the process of cloning, building, and installing software from GitHub repositories. It is versatile and can be adapted to work with many different projects, including those that use common build systems like CMake, Makefile, or configure scripts.

**Usage**:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure `git`, `make`, and other necessary build tools are installed on your system.
   - Install specific tools required by the project (like `cmake`) as per its documentation.

2. **Running the Script**:
   - Save the script as `github_build_install.sh`.
   - Make it executable: `chmod +x github_build_install.sh`.
   - Run the script: `./github_build_install.sh`.
   - Follow the prompts to enter the repository URL and select the build method.

3. **Customization**:
   - The script can be modified to include additional build methods or customized steps for specific projects.
   - The build directory can be changed as per the user's preference.

4. **Notes**:
   - The script guesses the build method based on common file indicators but allows the user to override this choice.
   - For complex projects with non-standard build processes, the user should follow the project's specific build instructions.

**Example Project**: XMRig

- XMRig is a popular open-source cryptocurrency miner that can be built using this script.
- For XMRig, the script typically guesses a CMake build, but users should verify this against the project's documentation.

This script and its documentation provide a starting point for automating builds from GitHub repositories. It's important to adapt and test the script with each specific project to ensure compatibility and successful builds.
